Small scripts and tools that are helpful


add_commas 
Put a list of numbers into a file called 'NeedCommas.txt' in the same directory as the script. The script will then add commas to the end of each number (except the last) and save the file. It will also print numbers + ,

I made this as I kept getting a bunch of Ids from SQL and I wanted to do a WHERE 'x' IN (large list of numbers that needs commas).

I make a folder on my desktop called, drop the script and .txt file into the folder, and when I need to run the script I alt + f + s + r to open powershell and type in python add_commas.py and away it goes (after you save your numbers into the .txt file).
